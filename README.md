# Build

## Usage

Populate `.env` with appropriate values and run the server

```bash
go run cmd/main.go
```



## ðŸ¤”Why does this exist?

I build a lot of random projectsâ€”most of them never make it past localhost ðŸ˜…. Eventually, I felt the need to pull out the commonly used pieces and turn them into a structured starting point.

This setup probably wonâ€™t work for everyoneâ€”or maybe even most people writing Goâ€”but Iâ€™m putting it out there anyway.
Itâ€™s mainly for my own sanity... and future me.
